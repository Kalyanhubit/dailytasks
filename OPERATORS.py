# ---------OPERATORS-----------
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
# print(5+6)
#
#
# -------types of operators------------
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators
#
#----------------------------- a.Arithmetic operators:--------------------------------------
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
#     + Addition
#     x + y
#
# x=50;
# y=50
# print(x+y)
#
#     - Subtraction
# print(x - y)
#
#     *Multiplication
# print(x * y)
#
#     / Division
# print(x / y)
#
#     % Modulus
# print(x % y)
#
#     ** Exponentiation
# print(x ** y)
#
#
#     // Floordivision
# print( x // y)
#
# ---------------------------b.assignment operators:----------------------------------------
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
#
# '='; x = 5; same as x = 5
# '+='; x += 3; same as  x = x + 3
# '-='; x -= 3; same as x = x - 3
# '*='; x *= 3; same as x = x * 3
# '/='; x /= 3;same as x = x / 3
# '%=' x; %= 3;same as x = x % 3
# '//='; x //= 3; same as x = x // 3
#
# -----------------------------c.Python Identity Operators---------------------------------
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if
# they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
#
#     x is y
# is Returns True if both variables are the same object
#     x is not
# is not Returns True if both variables are not the same object
#
#
# fruits=int(input("enter the fruit:"))
# if fruits is "apple":
#     if fruits is not "apple":
#     print("apple is a fruit")
#         print("apple na")
#------------------- d.Python Membership Operators---------------------------------
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
#
# 'in' Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
# x in y
# 'not in' Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object
# x not in y
#
# y=input("enter the fruit")
# x=["apple","bannana","orange","kiwi"]
# if y in x:
#     print(" is present")
#     if y not in x:
#         print("not present")
# ----------------------------Python Bitwise Operators---------------------------------
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
#
# '&'    -      AND -------------Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# '|'    -        OR Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# '^'    - XOR Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# '~'    - NOT Inverts all the bits
